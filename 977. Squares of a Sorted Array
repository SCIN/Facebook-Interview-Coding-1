977. Squares of a Sorted Array

We can use two pointers to read the positive and negative parts of the array - 
one pointer j in the positive direction, and another i in the negative direction.

Time O(n), Space O(n)

Now that we are reading two increasing arrays (the squares of the elements), we can merge these arrays together using a two-pointer technique.
vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& A) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = A.size() - 1;
    vector<int> ret(A.size(), 0);
    int position = A.size() - 1;
    // including overlap
    while (left <= right) {
        int x = A[left] * A[left];
        int y = A[right] * A[right];
        if (x < y) {
            ret[position] = y;
            right--;
        } else {
            ret[position] = x;
            left++;
        }
        position--;
    }
    return ret;
}

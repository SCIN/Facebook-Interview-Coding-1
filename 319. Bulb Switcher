319. Bulb Switcher

This is a math problem.

Numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) can be grouped into 3 groups.
1. primes
2. square
3. non-primes except square

Primes will be turned on at 1 and itself -> off
Non-primes will be turned on at every factor pairs. eg 6, (1 6), (2 3) -> off
Squares will be turned on at factor pairs and itself. eg 4 (1 4), ->off, (2 2) ->on

Therefore only the square numbers can be on at last.
There are sqrt(n) number of square numbers from 1 to n(inclusive).

int bulbSwitch(int n) {
    return sqrt(n);
}
